# Arduheater

Arduheater is a heat controller built for astronomy use.
Controlling dew is a big thing if you really intent to do astronomy all year around.

It was built on top of a standard ATmega 328 Arduino such as UNO, Pro or Nano; currently it does not support the Mega or any other ARM based board.
The hardware was designed to be simple enough to be built by anyone with minimal soldering skills or electronic knowledge.

The source is still under heavy development so things move around a bit.
